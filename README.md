This is a Docker lab. 
Use the code in here and get both of the apps building with Dockerfiles. 
There will be a Dockerfile for each the root and the public directories.
Use docker-compose to launch both of the containers at the same time with the right port configurations.
Once they are both build correctly, add a directory for a router/load balancer.
Have the router send requests for /node to the node container and for the .index.html to the public (nginx) container.
Don't have any specific IP or domain name information in the repository.`
